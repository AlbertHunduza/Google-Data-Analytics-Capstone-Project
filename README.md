# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project - Bellabeat Case Study

Welcome to the README file for the Google Data Analytics Capstone Project, focused on the Bellabeat data analysis case study. I did this project as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program.

## Introduction

In this project, I have performed various real-world tasks as a junior data analyst, imagining I am working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The goal was to answer key business questions and follow the data analysis process steps: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

By the end of this project, I have created a portfolio-ready case study that demonstrates my knowledge and skills to potential employers.

## Scenario

I played the role of a junior data analyst at Bellabeat, tasked with analyzing smart device data to gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. The insights gathered were intended to guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
